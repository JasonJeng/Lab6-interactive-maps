# Interactive Maps with Folium!
This tutorial uses a Python library called [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), which builds on a common web mapping javascript library called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). Basically, Folium brings the power of Leaflet JavaScript into Python, which means you can build really nice, interactive maps right into your Python notebook!

Students use folium, pandas, and JSON libraries to map Starbuck distributions in the LA region in this lab. Students will learn how to pass wanted information from the geojson file to the panda data frame. And map the output based on the data frame. The second output, without a doubt, makes more sense to me compared to the first map, which is based on the zip code. As the tutorial mentioned, zip codes are hardly used in real life besides mailing systems. Thus the Starbuck density based on zip code barely tells helpful information. In contrast, marking each Starbuck in LA and roads can efficiently reflect Starbucks' spatial relationship and distribution.

This tutorial is based on [this Medium Tutorial by Ritvik Kharkar](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-3-easy-maps-with-python-fb7dfb1036) and the associated [Github repo for his tutorial](https://github.com/ritvikmath/StarbucksStoreScraping). I've updated deprecated Folium code; re-orderd some of the steps to explain how his use of zip codes as a geography, while well intentioned and executed, is a huge conceptual problem; and added a brief follow-up showing a solid use of administrative units for choropleth maps.
